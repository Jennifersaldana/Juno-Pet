# Juno Pet

#### This is a Godot mobile game I'm developing called "Juno Pet." 

In this game, players will experience the joy and responsibility of taking care of a virtual cat. 
Users will have an intuitive interface to feed, wash, and pet their feline friend. Additionally, players 
can purchase various items like beds and food through the inventory system to enhance their cat's living environment.

## Features
The game features five distinct areas where the cat can roam: the living room, kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, 
and a visit to the vet. This setup not only provides diverse interactive experiences but also helps children learn 
the essential aspects of caring for a pet.

## To Open
1. Download the zip file in the main branch. 
2. Download the Godot engine here https://godotengine.org/ 
3. Open the file called "Juno" in Godot and select the project.godot file to open the game.
4. Press Command + B to run the game for Mac to run the game.
Enjoy!
